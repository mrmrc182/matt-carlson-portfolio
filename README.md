#<matt-carlson-portfolio>

## Description-
This is my portfolio.  It will be continously updated as I progress through my career as a software engineer.

To start off, I wrote the HTML.  We were provided a template to follow which helped.  Since this is just a starter that will then be updated with projects, I decided to use cats as my placeholder images because I like them.  For my inspirational quote I picked a lyric from a band I like.

Then came the fun part- the CSS.  CSS has never been my strongest language but it felt good to push myself on this.  Lots of experimentation happened.  

## Contributors-
I did the editing, and received help from both my instructor John and TA Michael.
